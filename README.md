# MassTextEditor
Have you ever had a massive file on your hands and you needed to edit a ton of text?
Maybe you needed to remove all the lines with numbers, or just the ones with a # symbol.
With the MassTextEditor, you can do that extremely quickly!

We created this program because we needed an english library for another program.
However, we didn't want any proper names so we needed a way to remove all lines with
capital letters. We also didn't want numbers or any special characters. This would've
meant removing over 70,000 lines by hand!!

Instead, we created the MassTextEditor to take care of this for you. Give it a try!

<br>**Future updates:** Support for more kinds of text files (breaks by comma, space, etc.)
and more actions.
